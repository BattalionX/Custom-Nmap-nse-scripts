# Custom-Nmap-nse-scripts
I am trying to revitalize the tired nmaps scripting engine with fresh new scripts to help pen-testers and Cyber security folks. I would love to collaborate with you. If you don't have time then drop me some good ideas and come back and see what I come up with. Hope to hear from you all soon, no need to be shy.

## My Journey

I've been coding since the days when COBOL and FORTRAN were the cool kids on the block. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with a vast array of languages, from the classic to the cutting-edge.  
My career has taken me all over the globe, and I've had the distinct pleasure of being removed from Russia by Putin himself—talk about a first-class trip to Sheremetyevo International Airport!

## Languages I Speak

Here's a taste of the programming languages I'm fluent in:

COBOL, Smalltalk, REXX, FORTRAN, Basic, PostScript, Ada, Pascal, C, C++, C#, Java, Clojure, TypeScript, Python, VB, Perl, Lua, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Ruby, Swift, Objective-C, Scala, Dart, Haskell, Go, Scheme, ML, Rust, Julia, Elixir, Tcl, Forth, AWK, R, Crystal, ELM, Nim, ReasonML, Haxe, MATLAB/Simulink, VHDL/Verilog

## Projects

For now I am preparing to share **.nse scripts** for Nmap's tired scripting engine. Nmap is a tool I started using way back when it first came out. There isn’t anything any better. I was writing Lua scripts for my job for many years. Many of those however I cannot share, some I can and I plan to.

I took a break after I retired, but I did start doing some freelancing recently because when you try to slow down but your body says “Let's Do Something, Time's Blowing By.” So I started back up taking jobs I want and passing on the jobs I didn’t want.

As I mentioned, I am back coding. My fav is a project I wanted to take on because it is fairly easy: to breathe some life into Nmap's scripting engine. I really hate that people are just letting the tired scripts die. So I have a goal to try and spark more interest in revitalizing it.

**So if you want to join me then email or message me. Let’s work together!**  
If you don’t have time to contribute, then drop me a line with some suggestions and leave the rest up to me. I will take your idea and run with it.
