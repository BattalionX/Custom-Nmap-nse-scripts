# Custom-Nmap-nse-scripts
I am trying to revitalize the tired nmaps scripting engine with fresh new scripts to help pen-testers and Cyber security folks. I would love to collaborate with you. If you don't have time then drop me some good ideas and come back and see what I come up with. Hope to hear from you all soon, no need to be shy.
